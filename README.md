# DOS C Programs and Utilities
I wrote these programs and utilities, when I was a teenager in the 90s, for MS-DOS 5.0 and MS-DOS 6.22 etc. I used Turbo C and later Turbo C++. I'll port each program to Open Watcom C 2.0, add comments, and refactor code. Add a Makefile, and after testing them using FreeDOS or DOSBox, I'll add it here.
